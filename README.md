# Empty-Nest
Projects for 2017

Hello world! 

"From the moment the sun comes up, we are in constant search of enlightenment. Picking, scratching, digging, and pecking are all studied exercises of this long-standing tradition of exploration as well as the source for nourishment. By becoming more mindful of the source of our nourishment and enjoying the pathway of gathering, we grow the spirit."
- Lynn Brunelle, Yoga for Chickens
